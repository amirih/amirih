## 👋 About Me
I am a Ph.D. candidate in **Computer Science at Emory University**, where my research focuses on **software engineering**, **high-performance computing**, **spatial data science**, and **simulation-based modeling**.  

My work centers on designing and developing scalable software systems that integrate robust engineering principles with the research goals of the [Spatial Computing Lab](https://spatial.cs.emory.edu/about-us.html). I am particularly interested in the intersection of **software engineering, parallel processing, and spatial computing**, with the goal of building frameworks that support reliable, large-scale computational ecosystems.
